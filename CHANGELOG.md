# Version 0.11.0 (unreleased)

## Features

- Virtual Text: The new `virtualtext.display_singleline` option shows only the
  remainder of the current line of the completion. When the completion
  starts with a newline, the next line is shown below the cursor instead of
  inline to its right, matching where accepting it actually puts it; the
  rest stays cached so it can still be accepted line by line.
- Virtual Text: The new `accept_chunk` action accepts the completion one chunk
  at a time, where a chunk is the current identifier plus the special
  characters that follow it (for example `foo.bar(a, b).baz(c)` is accepted as
  `foo.` `bar(` `a, ` `b).` `baz(` `c)`). A chunk never crosses a newline
  unless the newline is the first character of the completion, matching what
  the `display_singleline` view shows; a run like `)\n.` is accepted as
  `)` and then `\n.`. When the identifier of the current chunk has already
  been typed, the special characters that follow it end that chunk: after
  typing the `r` of `r#my_var_name`, the next chunk is `#` and only after
  that `my_var_name`.
  typing the `r` of `r#my_var_name`, the next chunk is `#` and only after
  that `my_var_name`.

## Streaming

- Streamed completions are rendered token by token as they arrive, so a
  longer `max_tokens` no longer means a longer wait for the first chunk.
  The completion is a character stream: the model keeps appending to the
  back up to the `max_tokens` cap while Tab or typing takes from the front,
  and the remaining text is re-rendered on every token within the single-line
  viewport rules.

## Removed

- The nvim-cmp and blink-cmp frontends are gone; virtual text is now the only
  completion frontend, alongside the built-in LSP sources. The `cmp` and
  `blink` config keys, `make_cmp_map`/`make_blink_map`, the `Minuet cmp` /
  `Minuet blink` commands, and `lsp.completion.warn_on_blink_or_cmp` were
  removed with them.
- The `n_completions` option is gone: virtual text can only show one
  completion at a time, so exactly one candidate is always generated.

# Version 0.10.0 (2026-07-31)

## Features

- Duet can now use recent edits to provide more relevant next-edit predictions.
- Inline completion with the OpenAI-compatible provider now uses prefix-first
  prompts by default.
- Updated the default models for OpenAI-compatible completions and Duet.

## Improvements

- Improved support for custom request configurations and AWS
  Bedrock-compatible services.

## Fixes

- Improved whitespace handling for FIM completions.

# Version 0.9.0 (2026-04-26)

## Breaking Changes

- LSP configuration restructure: The LSP configuration has been reorganized into
  separate `completion` and `inline_completion` sections:

## Features

- Duet (Next Edit Prediction): Introduced a new experimental feature for
  next-edit prediction. Duet analyzes the context around the cursor and suggests
  edits within an editable region. This feature is still highly experimental and
  remains a WIP.
- LSP inline completion: Added support for Neovim's built-in
  `vim.lsp.inline_completion` interface (Neovim 0.12+). Enable via
  `config.lsp.inline_completion.enable`.
- New configuration options:
  - `config.curl_cmd`: Customize the curl command used for HTTP requests.
  - `config.curl_extra_args`: Pass additional arguments to curl.
- Provider updates:
  - Change default `openai_fim_compatible` model from `deepseek-chat` to
    `deepseek-v4-flash`.
  - Change OpenAI default model to `gpt-5.4-nano` with prefix-first prompt
    strategy.
- Similar to the `openai_fim_compatible` provider, the `openai`, `claude`,
  `openai_compatible`, and `gemini` providers now support customizing the
  endpoint, headers, and request body via the `transform` option.
- Remove dependency on `plenary.nvim`. Minuet now uses the built-in
  `vim.system` API for HTTP requests.

# Version 0.8.0 (2025-12-13)

## Breaking Change

- Rename `config.enabled` to `config.enable_predicates`

## Features

- Virtual Text:
  - Continuous Line-by-Line Acceptance: The `accept_line` command now preserves
    partial accepted suggestion state. This allows users to accept multi-line
    suggestions incrementally by invoking the command repeatedly.
  - Preserved Suggestions During Multi-line Typing: Prefix-matched suggestions
    persist even while the user is typing multi-line text, to avoid unnecessary
    LLM requests and conserving resources.

# Version 0.7.0 (2025-12-09)

## Features

- defaults: set default `before_cursor_filter_length` to 2.
- claude: change default model to claude-haiku-4.5
- claude: change default `max_tokens` to 256
- add option `enabled` for dynamic enable at runtime
- virtualtext: preserve completion items when user input matches existing completion items (#90)

# Version 0.6.0 (2025-08-11)

## Breaking Change

- Improve completion filtering with before/after context:
  - Refactors the completion filtering logic to be based on the longest common
    match.
  - Add a new `before-cursor-filter-length` config option to trim duplicated
    prefixes from completions based on the text before the cursor.
- Change default few-shot example: The default few-shot example has been
  updated to require the AI to combine information from before and after the
  cursor to generate the correct logic.
- Update default system prompt: The system prompt is refined to be more concise
  and provide clearer instructions to the AI on handling various completion
  scenarios like code, comments, and strings.

## Features

- Make endpoint configurable for Gemini and Claude: Users can now
  specify custom API endpoints for Gemini and Claude providers.

## Fixes

- Handle empty string for non-stream requests : Ensures that empty string
  responses from the API are handled correctly for non-streaming requests.

## Other

- Refactor Gemini requests : Updated Gemini requests to use the
  `x-goog-api-key` header to align with upstream changes.
- Use lower case string instead of numbers to send signals, as recommended by
  luv manual.

# Version 0.5.2 (2025-05-11)

## Features

- lsp: add option `adjust_indentation` for completion items.
- lualine: display provider and model name.
- chat input template can be a list of strings.

## Fixes

  virtual text completion.

# Version 0.5.1 (2025-04-08)

## Features

- Added `transform` option for OpenAI-FIM-compatible providers.

  This feature enables support for non-OpenAI-FIM-compatible APIs with
  OpenAI-FIM-compatible provider, such as the DeepInfra FIM API. Example
  configurations are available in [recipes.md](./recipes.md).

# Version 0.5.0 (2025-03-28)

## Breaking Changes

- Modified the Gemini provider's default prompt strategy to use the new
  **Prefix First** structure.
- Other providers will continue to use their previous default prompt
  configurations.

## Features

- lsp: always `prepend_to_complete_word` without checking `TriggerCharacter`
- Add a new "Prefix-First" prompt structure for chat LLMs.

# Version 0.4.2 (2025-03-21)

- Lualine integration: add spinner component.
- **lsp**: add detail field to show provider name.
- **Minuet Event**: add three user events during its request workflow.

## Fixes

- **lsp**: handle request where params.context is not provided (for mini.completion).

# Version 0.4.1 (2025-03-19)

## Breaking Change

- **lsp**: Don't explicitly disable auto trigger for filetypes not in `enabled_auto_trigger_ft`.

## Fixes
